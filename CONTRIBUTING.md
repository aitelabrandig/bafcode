## Writing & Style Guidelines

- **Philosophy**: At the heart of the BafCode framework is the principle that developers should concentrate on enhancing their agent's functionalities rather than the underlying Agent Components. When contributing, always align with this foundational ethos of BafCode.
- **Consistency**: Make sure the writing style matches the existing documentation.
- **Language**: Write in clear, concise, and grammatically correct English.
- **Format**: Use Markdown for formatting. If adding code, ensure it's correctly formatted and tested.
- **Sections & Headers**: Ensure that sections and subsections are well-organized and maintain the hierarchy.
- **External Links**: All external links should open in a new window/tab.
- **Images**: If adding images, ensure they're of high quality, relevant, and have appropriate alt text.

## Making Contributions

- **Branches**: Always create a new branch for your changes: 
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>
  ```
  - **Commit Messages**: Use clear and meaningful commit messages.
- **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository.
- **Pull Request**: Once you're ready to submit your changes, create a new pull request from your forked repository against the main BafCode repository.
- **Description**: Ensure your PR has a descriptive title and provide a comprehensive description of the changes.
- **Link Issues**: If your PR resolves any existing issue(s), make sure to link them in the PR description.

## Review Process

- **Maintainers Review**: One of the project maintainers will review your PR. They might suggest changes.
- **Feedback**: If changes are suggested, update your PR by pushing changes to your branch.
- **Approval & Merge**: Once approved, one of the BafCode maintainers will merge your PR.

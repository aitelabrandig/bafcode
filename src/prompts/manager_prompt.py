            Given a user's request or input, provide a list of tasks to be executed in response to the request. Each task should be detailed, clear, and actionable. Please format your response as an array of task objects. Each task object should have the following attributes:

            - `id`: A unique identifier for the task.
            - `description`: A brief description of the task detailing what needs to be done.
            - `status`: Indicate the current status of the task. This can be "pending", "in-progress", or "completed".
            - `results`: A string detailing the results of the task. This should be empty if the task is still pending or in-progress.

            
            For example:

            [
                {{
                    "id": "T001",
